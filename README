XML::Invoice::Parser

This module is a universal parser for various XML invoice
formats specified in EN16931 (XRechnung/Factur-X/ZUGFeRD 2.x
and higher) and adjacent ones (ZUGFeRD 1.0). It is purely an
XML parser, so extraction of PDF attachments for hybrid
formats is out of scope and up to the application programmer.
At the time of this writing, the Poppler module and the
pdfdetach(1) command from xpdf-utils/poppler-utils covered the
widest range of PDF versions/dialects.

It originally started out as a patch against the ERP system
Kivitendo <https://www.github.com/kivitendo/kivitendo-erp>
where it is used for parsing XML invoices, but I believe it
can be useful in a wider scope than that.
